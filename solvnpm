Hy , sorry for the late comment :

if you facing this issue , you can run these command on terminal

-> npm install --save-dev vite laravel-vite-plugin

Then you need to update your package.json file

"scripts": { "dev": "vite", "build": "vite build" }

Finally, you can trigger this command below to build Vite and create the manifest file.

-> npm run build

your problem is solved, Boom!!!!
